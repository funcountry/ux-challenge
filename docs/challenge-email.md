Subject: UX Engineering Challenge - React Native Screen Implementation

---

Hello üëã

We're excited to move forward with your interview process! As part of our technical evaluation, we'd like you to complete a short React Native implementation challenge.

## The Challenge üé®

You'll be implementing a single screen design from a Figma mockup (link to be provided separately). This is an opportunity to showcase your attention to visual detail, React Native skills, and ability to create smooth, polished interactions.

## Getting Started üöÄ

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd ux-challenge
   ```

2. **Create your working branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b yourname-result
   ```
   (Please replace "yourname" with your actual name)

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the app:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Then choose your platform:
   - Press `i` for iOS simulator (Mac only)
   - Press `w` for web browser (all platforms)
   - Press `a` for Android
   - Scan QR code with Expo Go app for physical device
   
   See [troubleshooting.md](./troubleshooting.md) if you encounter any issues

5. **Complete the challenge:**
   - Either:
     - Replace the Welcome screen with your Figma implementation, OR
     - Add a new screen to the app with a way to navigate from the Welcome screen
   - The existing Welcome screen shows sample instructions when you click "Get Started"
   - Focus on matching the design as closely as possible

6. **Push your work:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Implement [screen name] design"
   git push origin yourname-result
   ```

## Important Notes üìù

- **Time expectation:** Please spend no more than 1 hour on this challenge
- **Scope:** Focus on implementing the visual design accurately - don't worry about backend integration or complex state management
- **AI usage:** Use of AI is encouraged, as needed
- **Creativity welcome:** Feel free to add subtle animations or interactions that enhance the user experience, as long as the core design remains faithful to the Figma
- **Pixel perfection:** We're particularly interested in your attention to spacing, typography, and visual hierarchy

## Need Help? ü§ù

If you run into any environment setup issues or can't access the Figma file, please don't hesitate to reach out immediately. We want you to spend your time showcasing your skills, not debugging configuration issues!

## What We're Looking For üëÄ

- Accurate implementation of the design
- Clean, maintainable code structure
- Smooth interactions and animations (where appropriate)
- Consideration for different screen sizes
- React Native best practices

Looking forward to seeing your implementation! Good luck!

Best regards,
Poker Skill Team
